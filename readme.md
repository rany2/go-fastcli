# go-fastcli 

Fast.com client in Go with latency, download and upload testing abilities.

## To build

* `git clone https://github.com/rany2/go-textsynth.git`
* `go build ./cmd/go-textsynth`
* (or you can use `go install ...`, whichever you prefer)

## Notes

The latency and upload results are inaccurate when using a proxy.
